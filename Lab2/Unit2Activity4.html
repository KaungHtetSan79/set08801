        <h2>Professional Tips</h2>
        <p>When baking a cheesecake, it is important not to overbake it. You only want to bake it until the middle
            has a slight wiggle, not until it is rock solid.</p>
        <p>It is important that you use a water bath, discussed at the right, to ensure even baking of your
            cheesecake.</p>
        <aside>
            To create a water bath, use a pan that will allow you to fill it with boiling water that goes halfway up
            the springform pan in which the cake is placed.
